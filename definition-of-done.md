A common challenge for newly emerging agile teams is how to measure their progress throughout a Sprint. Often this conversation is brought to the forefront because of a constantly shifting burndown chart. The burndown chart drops when a developer finishes a story, but rises back up when the story is reject by the QA team or the end user. 

This often leads to a lot of confusion and excitement around the predictability of completing our Sprints on time. Soon, we find ourselves in debates where we try to determine if the feedback we have received is scope creep, and therefore should be a new story for our next Sprint, or is it really a bug, which will negatively influence our burndown chart. Worse, this additional work might prevent a timely deploy, delaying the value of our entire Sprint.

If this sounds familiar, you are not alone. In fact, this is such a common issue with Scrum teams that the suggested fix, “Definition of Done” has become a core component of Scrum. Below we see a nice Scrum checklist as well as a retrospective conversation highlighting this.

    Joe: "For this retrospective, I've brought a useful little checklist. Is there any of this stuff that we aren't doing?”

    Lisa: "Hmmm, let's see. Well, we're certainly missing Definition of Done".

    Joe: "Well, 'Definition of Done' is listed under 'Core Scrum' so it
    seems pretty important!

If you look around you can see a lot of debate about what the “Definition of Done” is and should be. The debate gets pretty heated at times, but the good news is that there is an easy fix. Stop doing Scrum. Instead try the under sold, under certified, version of agile software development – Kanban.

In Kanaban your “Defintion of Done” is simply when the code hits production. We don’t have to wait two weeks to release and we don’t have to worry about feature creep. If the user story meets MVP, we move it to production. If we need to add more features, we make a new story and the customer prioritizes that new story. Yes, this means that new feature could be our new top priority. We don’t cancel anything in progress, if we do a good job breaking up our stories they should only take about a day to complete. This means with a team size of at least two developers our new top priority will be started today or tomorrow. Tell me your customer wouldn’t prefer that over waiting three weeks to deploy the next Sprint.

No more feature creep debates, no more Sprint planning meetings, no more sandbagging so that you can safely meet your Sprint commitments.

Just constantly delivering stakeholder value.
